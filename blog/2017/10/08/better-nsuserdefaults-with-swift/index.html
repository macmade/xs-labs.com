<p>
    After reading the excellent <a href="https://mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-10-06-type-safe-user-defaults.html">"Type-Safe User Default"</a> article from <a href="https://mikeash.com/pyblog/">Mike Ash</a>, I thought it would be interesting to describe the solution I use in my projects, as the approach is quite different.
</p>
<p>
    I came up with this solution a long time ago, and the first implementation was originally written in Objective-C.<br />
    The goal remains the same: add safety to Cocoa's <code>NSUserDefaults</code>.
</p>
<p>
    As a reminder, <code>NSUserDefaults</code> is used to persist user settings in an app.<br />
    While it does the job, it has some drawbacks when it come to type safety, because values are not associated with a type. Moreover, values are retrieved and written using a string key, meaning it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with typos.
</p>
<p>
    An easy way to add safety, for both the values and the keys, is to create a wrapper class on top of <code>NSUserDefaults</code>.<br />
    Something like:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
public class Preferences
{
    public var someValue: Int
    {
        get
        {
            return UserDefaults.standard.integer( forKey: "someValue" )
        }
        set( value )
        {
            UserDefaults.standard.set( value, forKey: "someValue" )
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Unfortunately, such an approach leads to a lot of boilerplate code, as you'll need to wrap similarly each of your user default value.
</p>
<p>
    The solution I propose is to automate the wrapping code on runtime, using reflection.<br />
    This used to be done with the Objective-C runtime.<br />
    With Swift, it's even easier through the use of the <code>Mirror</code> class.
</p>
<p>
    In Swift, you can use a <code>Mirror</code> to reflect the properties of a custom class, like:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
import Cocoa

public class Preferences
{
    public var someValue:      Int = 0
    public var someOtherValue: Int = 42
}

let p = Preferences()
let m = Mirror( reflecting: p )

for c in m.children
{
    print( ( c.label ?? "" ) + " => " + String( describing: c.value ) )
}
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the <code>for</code> loop will enumerate each property of the <code>Preferences</code> class, printing its name and actual value.
</p>
<p>
    Now in order to avoid wrapping our properties, we'll use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html">Key Value Observing (KVO)</a>.<br />
    This will allow us to be notified of any change of a property.
</p>
<p>
    We'll start by reading the actual property value from <code>NSUserDefaults</code>.<br />
    Then we'll add an observer for each property, using a <code>Mirror</code>.<br />
    We'll do this in the class' initialiser:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
override init()
{
    super.init()

    for c in Mirror( reflecting: self ).children
    {
        guard let key = c.label else
        {
            continue
        }
        
        self.setValue( UserDefaults.standard.object( forKey: key ), forKey: key )
        self.addObserver( self, forKeyPath: key, options: .new, context: nil )
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    We'll also need to remove the observers in <code>deinit</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
deinit
{
    for c in Mirror( reflecting: self ).children
    {
        guard let key = c.label else
        {
            continue
        }
    
        self.removeObserver( self, forKeyPath: key )
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    That's it. From now on, we'll receive KVO notifications when the value of a property is changed.<br />
    We simply need to handle these notifications, and write the values to <code>NSUserDefaults</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
public override func observeValue( forKeyPath keyPath: String?, of object: Any?, change: [ NSKeyValueChangeKey : Any ]?, context: UnsafeMutableRawPointer? )
{
    var found = false 

    for c in Mirror( reflecting: self ).children
    {
        guard let key = c.label else
        {
            continue
        }
    
        if( key == keyPath )
        {
            UserDefaults.standard.set( change?[ NSKeyValueChangeKey.newKey ], forKey: key )
        
            found = true
        
            break
        }
    }

    if( found == false )
    {
        super.observeValue( forKeyPath: keyPath, of: object, change: change, context: context )
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    With this code in place, what is left to do is to declare the properties you want:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
@objc public class Preferences: NSObject
{
    @objc public dynamic var someIntegerValue:        Int       = 0
    @objc public dynamic var someStringValue:         NSString  = ""
    @objc public dynamic var someOptionalArrayValue:  NSArray?

    // Previous methods hereâ€¦
}
</pre>
<p>
    That's it. You don't have to write anything more.<br />
    Note the <code>@objc</code> and <code>dynamic</code> keywords, that are required for KVO.
</p>
<p>
    I like this approach, because it adds type-safety to <code>NSUserDefaults</code> while keeping the code very simple.<br />
    All you have to do is to declare the properties you want.

    And for Objective-C users, here's a similar implementation, using the Objective-C runtime:<br />
