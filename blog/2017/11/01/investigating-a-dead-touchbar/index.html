    <strong>Today my TouchBar finally died...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I own a second-generation MacBook Pro 15' with the TouchBar (mid-2017 model).<br />
    As many, I can't say I'm a big fan of this TouchBar gadget.<br />
    As a developer, spending most of my time coding, or doing stuff in the Terminal and in <code>vim</code>, I miss real function or escape keys.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, having TouchID on a Mac is awesome (T1 ftw), plus I usually use an external keyboard, so that's not really a big issue.<br />
    And of course, the machine itself is simply splendid.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the TouchBar never really worked on this machine.<br />
    Most of the time, it required multiple reboots simply to power-on. TouchID was working fine, so this was more a display issue.<br />
    Also, I was running the beta versions of macOS High Sierra, so I tought of a software-related issue.
</p>
<p>
    But now it looks like its definitely dead. No matter what I try, the TouchBar does not power-on.<br />
    It's just a useless black ribbon, at the top of my keyboard. 
</p>
<p>
    Booting in diagnostics mode reports no issue.<br />
    And no luck resetting the SMC and PRAM either.
</p>
<p>
    So I tried to investigate at the software level.
</p>
<p>
    The TouchBar runs an operating system of its own, apparently a variant of WatchOS, on a dedicated chip.<br />
    It communicates with macOS through a system service called <code>TouchBarServer</code>, used by the <code>ControlStrip</code> application (in <code>/System/Library/CoreServices</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Now while there's a <code>TouchBarServer</code> process running on my machine, there's no <code>ControlStrip</code> process.<br />
    This is obviously an issue.
</p>
<p>
    I tried to start the <code>ControlStrip</code> process manually, but that doesn't work.<br />
    So I thought I could try debugging it with <code>LLDB</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
lldb /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlStrip.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlStrip
</pre>
<p>
    Running the process gives the following output:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
Process 688 launched: '/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlStrip.app/Contents/MacOS/ControlStrip' (x86_64)

* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGABRT
    frame #0: 0x00007fff7c0dbe4e libsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill + 10
libsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill:

    0x7fff7c0dbe58 <+20>: retq   
Target 0: (ControlStrip) stopped.
</pre>
<p>
    Looks like <code>abort</code> is called somewhere, for some reason.<br />
    The backtrace gives:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">

    ...
</pre>
<p>
    Let's try to break on the first function before <code>abort</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
b ControlStrip`___lldb_unnamed_symbol1597$$ControlStrip
</pre>
<p>
    After the usual prologue, we can see the following stuff, in the disassembly:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
0x10004f046 <+6>:  callq  0x100079a92               ; symbol stub for: DFRCreateCAContext
0x10004f04b <+11>: movq   %rax, %rdi
0x10004f04e <+14>: callq  0x100079fb4               ; symbol stub for: objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue
0x10004f053 <+19>: movq   %rax, %rbx
0x10004f056 <+22>: movq   %rbx, %rdi
0x10004f059 <+25>: callq  0x100079f9c               ; symbol stub for: objc_release
0x10004f05e <+30>: testq  %rbx, %rbx
0x10004f061 <+33>: je     0x10004f06a               ; <+42>
0x10004f06a <+42>: leaq   0x31611(%rip), %rax       ; "TouchBarServer not running."
0x10004f071 <+49>: movq   %rax, 0x57a28(%rip)
0x10004f078 <+56>: callq  0x100079ed6               ; symbol stub for: abort
</pre>
<p>
    So the <code>ControlStrip</code> calls a <code>DFRCreateCAContext</code> function, which fails, returning <code>0</code>.
    It then calls <code>abort</code>, with a <code>TouchBarServer not running.</code> message.
</p>
<p>
    I already know the <code>TouchBarServer</code> process is running, so I can try making this test pass py placing the value <code>1</code> in the <code>rbx</code> register:<br />
    This way, I'll avoid the call to <code>abort</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
p $rbx=1
</pre>
<p>
    The process indeed continues normal execution, outputting a ton of AutoLayout issues (c'mon Apple...).<br />
    But obviously, the display stays dark...
</p>
<p>
    Now I'm convinced this is an hardware issue.<br />
    I also tried to reinstall a fresh copy of macOS High Sierra, and the problem persist.
</p>
<p>
    Looking at the system logs, I can also see:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">

[DFR] [deviceTerminate]

</pre>
<p>
    <strong>So yeah, I think I'm left with bringing this puppy to the nearest Apple Store for an exchange...<br />
    Fragile little things...</strong>
