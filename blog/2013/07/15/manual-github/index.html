<p>
    Back in the days, I released a Mac AppStore application called «Manual».<br />
    It was a simple GUI front-end for the UNIX manual pages.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/martyturner">Marty Turner</a> contacted me on Twitter, because he wanted to know if the app was still available somewhere.
    As it wasn't available anymore, he kindly proposed to maintain it.
</p>
<p>
    So I put the whole project on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/macmade/Manual">https://github.com/macmade/Manual</a>), and gave hime write access.
</p>
<p>
    I must say very pleased to see people getting interested in those «old» projects and wanting to maintain them.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks Marty : )
