    Well, a bunch of things...<br />
    Ok, there's no new iOS device... But I just don't care.
</p>
<p>
    I personally don't need a 16-core phone, with a 1Gb pixels camera. Do you (except for telling others you've got the biggest phone)?
</p>
<p>
    First of all, the new OSX Maverick looks awesome, and not only because the Finder now has tabs, or because the leather interface of iCal is history.
</p>
<p>
    It looks like an awesome work has been done at the kernel level.
</p>
<p>
    Memory compression, timer coalescing... That sounds like incredible and awesome work...<br />
    The end user won't know, but he will surely feel the difference, about power consumption and battery life...<br />
    And all that stuff is surely an incredible work, from a low-level perspective.
</p>
<p>
    Then, the new Mac Pro. A long awaited upgrade, for all the pro-users out there.<br />
    But it's not just an upgrade. Performance has been bumped of course, but the all new design is more important, in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
    It remembers me of the MacWorld 2000 keynote, when Apple introduced the G4 cube. An awesome and powerfull machine, enclosed in a brilliant design.<br />
    I bought one, back in the days, just because it was just so perfect.
</p>
<p>
    And that's a great news about Apple. After years with the same hardware design, they are now offering us something completely new, something we can love, something we want to lick…
</p>
<p>
    The pros will surely be happy with the new hardware specs, and it's a new beginning for Apple's hardware design.<br />
    So that's just great!
</p>
<p>
    Now about iOS 7…<br />
    A lot of people are complaining about the new icons, the flat look, etc.<br />
    Personnaly, while I don't like the new springboard icons, I think the whole OS user interface is great.
</p>
<p>
    Yep, it has some Android features. Yep, it has some Windows 8 look.
</p>
<p>
    But wait… I thought Android and Windows 8 had iOS features…
</p>
<p>
    So please leave the emotional part away, and once for a while, try to turn your brain on…
</p>
<p>
    I find it scary how the same people who said repeatedly that Apple needed to improve iOS user interface with something more modern are now already feeling nostalgic about iOS 6.
</p>
<p>
    You wanted a move, now you got it.<br />
    Like it or not, it's going to change things.<br />
    And if you're not ready to change your habbits, well next time don't criticize just because you need to say something.
</p>
<p>
    I think that today, Apple replied wonderfully of all those tight-asses saying that innovation died with Steve Jobs.
</p>
<p>
    And that's the best part of today's announcements.
</p>
<p>
    Big thanks to Johnny Ive, Craig Federighi and Tim Cook.
