<p>
    I just finished writing the coding style guide for XS-Labs projects.<br />
    It covers coding conventions for C, C++, Objective-C and x86 assembly.

    The project is <a href="https://github.com/macmade/XS-Labs-Style-Guide/">available on GitHub</a>, so feel free to comment or fork the project to adapt it to your needs...
