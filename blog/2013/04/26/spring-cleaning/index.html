    Ok folks, that’s it… A few days ago, I decided to close all my software development activities on my main site, <a href="http://www.eosgarden.com/">eosgarden.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It was a tough decision to make, as it implies the discontinuation of all previously published software.<br />
    But I really needed to stop focusing on the past, and on software I originally developed years ago.
</p>
<p>
    Simply some fresh air, in order to focus on new/actual stuff and personal projects.
</p>
<p>
    The eosgarden website will stay as-is, but will no longer be updated.<br />
    All published software have been discontinued, meaning they won’t be updated anymore.<br />
    Commercial software are now completely free to use (a valid serial number is provided on the download page).
</p>
<p>
    That’s the end of a long story, but I have to admit it feels good.<br />
    Maintaining all this stuff was just too much, between my work as a development engineer for <a href="http://www.digidna.net/">DigiDNA</a> (an awesome swiss-australian software company), my current and personal code projects, and my private life.
</p>
<p>
    So here we go, ready for a complete new start.<br />
    But this time, no more commercial software, and in fact no more end-user software at all.<br />
    I’ll just focus on the personal projects I want to develop, like the <a href="https://github.com/macmade/XEOS">XEOS Operating System</a>, and related stuff.<br />
    A new web home will soon be launched, for all of this stuff, so stay tuned…
</p>
<p>
    And hopefully, I’ll have some more time blogging now… : )
