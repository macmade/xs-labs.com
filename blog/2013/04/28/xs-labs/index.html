    That's it! Following my decision to close all eosgarden activities, here's the new home for my personal OpenSource projects: <a href="http://www.xs-labs.com/" title="XS-Labs">www.xs-labs.com</a>
</p>
<p>
    As said previously, I'll now focus only on the development of the <a href="http://www.xs-labs.com/en/projects/xeos" title="XEOS">XEOS Operating System</a>, and related projects.
</p>
<p>
    Enjoy!
