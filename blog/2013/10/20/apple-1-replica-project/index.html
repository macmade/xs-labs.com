    Ok, so here's the next insane project. ^^
</p>
<p>
    As an Apple fan, since the nineties, I'm <a href="http://www.xs-labs.com/en/archives/museum/">collecting old Apple hardware</a>..<br />
    I've kept all my old and beloved machines, and purchased some others.
</p>
<p>
    The oldest I've got is an Apple //e..<br />
    This machine was available in 1983.
</p>
<p>
    Obviously, this takes a lot of space, and I'm currently trying to concentrate on rare stuff..<br />
    And as I'm not a billionaire, there's one computer I'll most certainly never have in my collection: the Apple 1.
</p>
<p>
    This is the first computer ever made by Apple («Apple Computer Company» at the time)..<br />
    It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak, and sold for $666.66, without enclosure.
    Only about 200 units were made.
</p>
<p>
    A few Apple 1 still exists nowadays, and one was sold in 2013 for $668'000 (!!!)..<br />
    So obviously, this is a bit expensive.
</p>
<p>
    So I decided to build my own...
</p>
<p>
    A few replica projects exist (and actually look awesome), so I could simply purchase one, but I don't think that's enough fun.
</p>
<p>
    And as a programmer, I have to say I know almost nothing about electronics..<br />
    So this is a nice occasion to learn how those things are built..<br />
    I know it will certainly be a hard way of learning, but it doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>
    I've been able to find all the original schematics of the Apple 1, as well as the original Operation Manual.
</p>
<p>
    So the first steps will be:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1 - Identify the original components</strong>.<br />
    This should be relatively easy, as I should be able to find enough information from the schematics and from the other replica projects.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1 - Get the original components</strong>.<br />
    This will be harder, but I'm sure most of the components can still be purchased somewhere..<br />
    But it might take some time, as I want my replica to look exactly like the original.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1 - Build the motherboard</strong>.<br />
    This will be the harder part, as I know nothing about electronics, and as I want to design the PCB myself..<br />
    But it will certainly be a lot of fun ; )
</p>
<p>
    Right now, I'm testing various PCB design tools, like EAGLE on Mac, KiCAD or PCB on Linux..<br />
    I'll obviously need to dig deep into the electronic world, and read a lot of theory to understand how to use these programs.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe in a few years, I'll be able to have a first board printed...
</p>
<p>
    I know that may sound insane, but I'm pretty sure I'll actually enjoy this..<br />
    As a programmer, learning how stuff works at the electronic level is very interesting, and I'm pretty sure that this knowledge will help me, even with non-hardware projects.
</p>
<p>
    So I'll try to keep posting about this in the next months, with updates about the project's progress...
</p>
