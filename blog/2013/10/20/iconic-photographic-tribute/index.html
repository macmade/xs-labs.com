    I received yesterday my copy of the «Iconic» book, by Jonathan Zufi.
</p>
<p>
    As the title says, it's a «photographic tribute to Apple Innovation»..<br />
    The book consists of beautiful pictures of Apple's hardware, from the Apple 1 to the latest Macs and iPhones/iPads.
</p>
<p>
    It's really amazing...<br />
    The book is just gorgeous, and it's just an amazing work.
</p>
<p>
    So just <a href="http://iconicbook.com/">check it out</a>, whether you're an iPhone addict, Apple fanboy, or computer nostalgic like me... ^^.<br />
    And also check Jonathan Zufi's website, <a href="http://shrineofapple.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/">Shrine Of Apple</a>, with it's awesome collection of vintage Apple hardware.
