    I sometimes feel very nostalgic while using my computer.
    I find it amazing how things changed in a decade.
</p>
<p>
    I remember how some people laughed at me, when I was young, because I had a Macintosh and because I couldn’t run the latest PC games....<br />
    And I remember ignoring them, as I was already in love with those machines, trying to blindly hack Mac OS 7 with ResEdit (almost always resulting in disasters)...
</p>
<p>
    Now it sometimes feels like the exact opposite.
</p>
<p>
    And I’m always amazed to see that many people, journalist and fanboys in the Apple community only know about Apple since the Intel switch.
</p>
<p>
    But maybe that’s OK, it’s just me getting old ; )
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, I decided to catalog all the old/vintage hardware I still own. Tons of sweet memories!
</p>
<p>
    You can see the list here:.<br />
    <a href="http://www.xs-labs.com/en/archives/museum/">http://www.xs-labs.com/en/archives/museum/</a>
</p>
<p>
    It’s almost complete, even if I still need to catalog the old manuals I own, as some of them can be pretty rare nowadays…
</p>
<p>
    Enjoy,
</p>
