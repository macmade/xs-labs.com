<h3>1- Forewords</h3>
<p>
    In the <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">first part</a> of this tutorial, we discussed the basic requirements for designing C++ classes with automatic allocation.
</p>
<p>
    The given example was pretty simple. A class with only two integer values as members.<br />
    In such a case, the <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/#toc-2-1">copy-constructor</a> and the <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/#toc-2-2">assignment operator</a> implementations are trivial.
</p>
<p>
    Things get a little more complicated when the class needs to <strong>manage resources</strong>.<br />
    Such resources can be dynamically allocated memory, file handles, database connections, etc.
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial focuses on this specific case.  
</p>
<a name="toc-2"></a>
<h3>2 - String class interface</h3>
<p>
    As an example, we'll be designing a class representing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string</a>. Think of <code>std::string</code>.<br />
    Keep in mind the following examples will obviously lack many possible optimisations.
</p>
<p>
    We'll design the class as a wrapper for C-style strings (<code>const char *</code>).<br />
    Here's our public interface:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

class String
{
    public:
        
        String( void );
        String( const char * s );
        String( const String & o );
        String( String && o );
        ~String( void );
        
        String & operator =( const String & o );
        
        const char * GetCString( void ) const
        {
            return this->_cp;
        }
        
        size_t GetLength( void ) const
        {
            return this->_len;
        }
        
        friend void swap( String & s1, String & s2 )
        {
            using std::swap;
            
            swap( s1._cp,  s2._cp );
            swap( s1._len, s2._len );
        }
        
    private:
        
        char * _cp;
        size_t _len;
};
</pre>
<p>
    If you read <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">part one</a> of this tutorial, this should be quite clear.
</p>
<p>
    Note that I already implemented the <code>GetCString</code> and <code>GetLength</code> member methods, are they are perfectly trivial, as well as the <code>swap</code> function as it is covered by the <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">previous tutorial</a>.<br />
    <strong>Now let's take a look at the implementation for other members</strong>.
</p>
<a name="toc-3"></a>
<h3>String class implementation</h3>
<a name="toc-3-1"></a>
<h4>3.1 - Parameter-less constructor</h4>
<p>
    First of all, we want a <strong>parameter-less constructor</strong>, so we can declare empty string objects:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
{
    String s;
}
</pre>
<p>
    <strong>Such objects should be valid</strong>: the <code>GetCString</code> method should return an empty <code>char</code> pointer (<code>""</code>) rather than <code>nullptr</code> and <code>GetLength</code> should return <code>0</code>.
</p>
<p>
    So we can simply <strong>rely on the second constructor</strong>, taking a <code>char *</code> as argument, and pass an empty string:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String::String( void ): String( "" )
{}
</pre>
<a name="toc-3-2"></a>
<h3>3.2 - Main constructor</h3>
<p>
    The main constructor takes a <code>const char *</code> as argument.<br />
    As we don't know where that argument comes from, <strong>we'll make a copy</strong> (using <code>strdup</code>), so we can ensure our instance will remain valid.<br />
    We'll also check for a <code>NULL</code> value, and fall back to an empty string (<code>""</code>):
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String::String( const char * s )
{
    if( s == nullptr )
    {
        s = "";
    }
    
    this->_cp  = strdup( s );
    this->_len = strlen( s );
}
</pre>
<a name="toc-3-3"></a>
<h4>3.3 - Destructor</h4>
<p>
    As we're copying the string passed to our main constructor, we need to <code>free</code> it in the destructor.
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String::~String( void )
{
    free( this->_cp );
}
</pre>
<a name="toc-3-4"></a>
<h4>3.4 - Copy constructor</h4>
<p>
    Now let's implement the <strong>copy constructor</strong>.<br />
    As you can guess, we need here to <strong>copy the C string from the other object</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    We cannot simply assign the pointer value, as the two objects would then share the same pointer.<br />
    <strong>This would cause the destructor to crash, as we cannot free the same pointer twice</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    So:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String::String( const String & o ):
    _len( o._len )
{
    this->_cp  = strdup( o._cp );
}
</pre>
<p>
    Note that we also copy the string length. No reason to recompute it.
</p>
<a name="toc-3-5"></a>
<h4>3.5 - Move constructor</h4>
<p>
    As stated in <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">part one</a> of this tutorial, our move constructor will actually <strong>move/steal</strong> resources from the object passed as argument.
</p>
<p>
    So no string copying here, we'll simply assign the string pointer to the other object's one.
</p>
<p>
    But we cannot stop here, as then the two objects would again share the same pointer value, causing the destructor to crash (double free).
</p>
<p>
    So we need to <strong>reset</strong> the members of the object passed by reference.<br />
    Here, will simply set the string pointer to <code>nullptr</code>.<br />
    The destructor will be fine, as it's OK to call <code>free</code> on a <code>NULL</code> pointer.<br />
    Also, we can safely assume that the object passed as an <strong>rvalue reference</strong> won't be used after it has been moved.
</p>
<p>
    In other words:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String::String( String && o ):
    _cp(  o._cp )
    _len( o._len )
{
    o._cp  = nullptr;
    o._len = 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see, we simply <strong>steal</strong> the resources from the passed object.<br />
    Then we set its value to default ones, so it can later be deallocated without any issue.
</p>
<a name="toc-3-6"></a>
<h4>3.6 - Assignment operator</h4>
<p>
    Now let's take a look at the assignment operator.
</p>
<p>
    As stated in <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">part one</a> of this tutorial, the assignment operator needs to copy the values from the object passed as parameter.  
    <strong>But first of all, it will also need to free any acquired resources</strong>:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String & String::operator =( const String & o )
{
    free( this->_cp );
    
    this->_cp  = strdup( o._cp );
    this->_len = o._len;
    
    return *( this );
}
</pre>
<a name="toc-4"></a>
<h3>4 - Optimising the assignment operator</h3>
<p>
    We could actually stop here, as our implementation is perfectly valid.<br />
    But maybe you noticed some <strong>redundant code with the copy constructor and the assignment operator</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Both need to copy the <code>char</code> pointer from another object.  
    The only difference is that the assignment operator needs to free the previous resources before the copy can take place.
</p>
<p>
    Not a big deal in our <code>String</code> class example, but depending on the type of resources managed by the object, this can lead to many lines of <strong>duplicate code</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We can actually avoid this in a very nice and clean way</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    In the actual implementation of the assignment operator, the source object is passed as a <strong>constant reference</strong>.<br />
    But unlike the copy constructor, this is not a requirement.<br />
    <strong>The object can also be passed by value, if needed</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    What would happend then?
</p>
<p>
    In <a href="/en/blog/2016/11/28/cpp-auto-alloc-part-1/">part one</a> of this tutorial, we saw that the compiler will use the <strong>copy constructor</strong> when passing objects by value.<br />
    This is great, as our copy constructor already does all the required stuff.
</p>
<p>
    But we also need, in the assignment operator, to free the previous resources.<br />
    <strong>Well, we'll simply use here our <code>swap</code> function</strong>, to exchange our existing values with the one of the other object.
</p>
<p>
    Take a look at this implementation:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
String & String::operator =( String o )
{
    swap( *( this ), o );
    
    return *( this );
}
</pre>
<p>    
    No more duplicate code! But what's actually happening?
</p>
<p>
    First of all, the assigned object is no longer passed as a reference. <strong>It is now passed as a copy</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    It means that the compiler will make a <strong>temporary copy</strong> before calling the assignment operator, using the <strong>copy constructor</strong>.<br />
    The lifetime of that temporary copy is determined by the scope of the assignment operator, meaning it will be <strong>deallocated right after the assignment operator returns</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    So by simply <strong>swapping</strong> ourself with the other object, as it is a temporary copy, not only are we acquiring its resources, but we'll also <strong>have it free our own resources</strong> for us.
</p>
<p>
    This optimisation is of course not required, but I highly recommend using it, as it keeps the assignment operator trivial, by simply relying on the <strong>copy constructor</strong> and the <code>swap</code> function.
</p>
