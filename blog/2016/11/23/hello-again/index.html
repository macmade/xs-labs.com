   More than a year passed since my last post, and since I announced that I was leaving my position as the lead developer of <a href="https://imazing.com/" title="iMazing">iMazing</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Well, it did not last long, as I was in fact hired back in May 2015, at the exact same position.<br />
    And obviously, I've been pretty busy since then, hence the lack of updates on this site.
</p>
<p>
    We've been mainly working on the <strong>second major update</strong> of iMazing.<br />
    Version 2.0 was released at same time as iOS 10.0, along with a completely new <a href="https://imazing.com/" title="iMazing">website</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Along with a refreshed user interface, iMazing 2.0 provides many new features, like <a href="https://imazing.com/features/backup-iphone-ipad" title="iMazing">automatic backup archiving</a> (think TimeMachine for your iPhone/iPad).<br />
    We also focused on a better user experience, when backing-up or restoring devices.
</p>
<p>
    iMazing 2.0 is also the only software capable of editing encrypted backups, regardless of the iOS version.<br />
    We're in fact already compatible with the upcoming iOS 10.2 release, which have some major security improvements in local backups.
</p>
<p>
    So I'm pretty happy to be back, and continue to develop that awesome software.<br />
    And obviously, and as always, I'll try to do more blog posts in the future... : )
