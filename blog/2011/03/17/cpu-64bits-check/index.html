    I had to make a little Mac OS X application that check if the processor has a 64Bits instruction set or not.<br />
    I made that for <a href="http://www.eosgarden.com/en/products/webstart/">WebStart</a>, as it only run on 64Bits machines, so users can test their own processor before downloading and buying the software.

    It's not a great deal, since there are <code>__x86_64__</code> and <code>__i386__</code> macros, but in case you need such an app, it's available on GitHub, released under the Boost license.<br />
    Feel free to use it:

    I also made the icon myself, which is available in 2000px. Also feel free to use it without copyright limitations if you need it!<br />
    Enjoy!
