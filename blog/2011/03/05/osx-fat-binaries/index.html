<p>
    Just a little reminder (also to myself)...
</p>
<p>
    Mac OS X support a lot of different processor architectures.<br />
    From PPC to Intel, including ARM (for iOS), all of these with 32 or 64 bits instruction sets.
</p>
<p>
    When compiling a C file with GCC under Mac OS X, only the current CPU architecture will be compiled by default.
</p>
<p>
    For instance:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -o test test.c
</pre>
<p>
    Will produce an executable supporting only one architecture (similar to the host machine).
</p>
<p>
    The executable format is called «Mach-O», and is specific to OS X.
</p>
<p>
    The Mach-O format supports more than one architecture.<br />
    It means you can have a single binary file, which contain code that will run on different CPU architectures.
</p>
<p>
    Apple introduced that format with Mac OS X, while preparing the transition from the PowerPC architecture to Intel.<br />
    The same thing was done for the M68K to PPC transition.<br />
    But it's also used to run binaries with 32 or 64 bits instruction sets.
</p>
<p>
    To see what kind of architecture an executable file supports, your can use the «lipo» command.<br />
    For instance, on my computer (Intel x86_64):
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
lipo -info /bin/bash
</pre>
<p>
    will return:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
Architectures in the fat file: /bin/bash are: x86_64 i386
</pre>
<p>
    Meaning the executable can be run on Intel 64bits or 32bits processors.
</p>
<p>
    In order to compile an executable for a specific processor architecture, you can pass the <code>-arch</code> option to GCC.<br />
    For instance, to compile a FAT binary, that will run on 64 and 64 bits intel processors:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -arch x86_64 -arch i386 -o test test.c
</pre>
