    Today, I decided to create a light and free version of WebStart.
</p>
<p>
    It will only include Apache 2, MySQL 5.1, and PHP 5.3.<br />
    Only one virtual host will be available by default (but you can still tweak the configuration files).
</p>
<p>
    No log file viewing, no configuration editing, no OpenLDAP, no easy website creation and management, no SCM...<br />
    But it will be free. : )
