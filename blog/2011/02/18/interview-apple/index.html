<p>
    The interview is done!<br />
    Two hours, with a SpringBoard Apps manager, and a GameKit manager, writing C code on a sheet of paper.
<p>
<p>
    Linked lists, hash tables, big O notation, search algorithms, bitwise operations... <br />
    Everything on paper.<br />
    It's kinda hard! And I have to say I felt stupid some times...
</p>
<p>
    But they said I did well. So I'll have to wait for an answer.<br />
    Whatever happens, it's already amazing that Apple contacted me, and wanted to interview me here in Barcelona.
</p>
<p>
    Now I'll enjoy my stay here, till sunday, having champagne on my private deck in the hotel.<br />
    Cheers!
