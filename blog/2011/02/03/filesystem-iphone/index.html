    I'm about to release an iPhone app I created a (very) long time ago.
</p>
<p>
    It allows to browse through the whole iPhone file system, displaying files and directories, with infos and previews.<br />
    I doubt such an app will be validated by the AppStore team, but who knows.
</p>
<p>
    I had to re-create the project with the new XCode 4, because it was created for iOS 2.<br />
    Now it's also ready for a future iPad version.
</p>
<p>
    If it's not validated, I think I'm going to release the source code as OpenSource...
</p>
<p>
    More on a few days...
