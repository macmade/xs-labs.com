<p>
    Today, I decided to <a href="http://www.eosgarden.com/en/products/webstart/overview/">announce</a> WebStart, eosgarden's major product.<br />
    No release date has been fixed, but I'm very close to the end of the development.
</p>
<p>
    The main purpose of WebStart is to provide you with a workable web and database server.<br />
    Therefore, it includes the Apache 2 HTTP server (with the PHP scripting language), the MySQL database server, and the OpenLDAP directory service.
</p>
<p>
    But WebStart is more than just a packaged version of those software. It also provides you with a full-featured web development environment, with more than 50 useful tools, that web developers often need.
</p>
<p>
    It has software for automatic image generation, software revision control, document conversion, automated documentation generation, testing, etc.
</p>
<p>
    All that stuff is installed in a specific directory, separate from the system paths, so you don't have to worry when you upgrade your Mac OS X system. It does not replace any exisiting software on your computer. It's just here at your convenience, so you can concentrate on your development tasks, rather than on compiling and installing software again and again from scratch.
