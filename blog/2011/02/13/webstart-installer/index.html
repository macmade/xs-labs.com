    Today, I ended the development of the WebStart custom installer.<br />
    I've just tested the application on a fresh Mac OS X installation, and everything is working like a charm, out of the box.

<p>
    Now, I just need to finish writing the documentation, for the application and on the website, take a decision for the pricing, and it will be over...

<p>
    I probably won't have time to finish everything this week, as I'm flying to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress.<br />
    But maybe next week... Stay tuned!
