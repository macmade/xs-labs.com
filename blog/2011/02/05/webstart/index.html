    Here’s a little preview of what’s coming next…<br />
    WebStart is an webserver control application, including full-featured Apache, MySQL, OpenLDAP servers, as well as a complete development environment for OS X.<br />
    The application was originally developed on Mac OS X 10.4, so I’m going to update it for 10.6, with XCode 4.<br />
    It might tight some time for the update, but I’m decided to release this little piece of software.

    So stay tuned, I’m now concentrating on that…
