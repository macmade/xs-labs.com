    As a programmer, I do love developing freeware, or OpenSource software.<br />
    But sometimes, it's just not an option.
</p>
<p>
    When you passed just too many days and nights coding, you'll certainly think about selling your software.<br />
    The question is how?
</p>
<p>
    Selling a software implies creating a web-shop, with credit-card support, having a good serial number system, and maybe an online activation system.
</p>
<p>
    Not easy... When you're software is ready, you usually don't want to spend more time for those tasks...
</p>
<p>
    I personally use the «eSellerate» system: <a href="http://www.esellerate.net/">http://www.esellerate.net/</a>
</p>
<p>
    They just manage everything. Serial numbers, online activation, custom web-shops, in-app purchase, physical CD delivery, etc...
</p>
<p>
    They provide a very well documented SDK (static library), that you can embed into your software.<br />
    No more hassle. It just works...
</p>
<p>
    So if you need to sell software, and don't want to spend time on other things than developing, just take a look.
