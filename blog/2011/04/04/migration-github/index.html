    I've just migrated all eosgarden's OpenSource projects from GoogleCode to GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    I must say I still prefer SVN over GIT, as a version control system. That said, that's maybe because I got a strong experience with SVN, and not with GIT.
</p>
<p>
    For now, the cool thing about GIT is the local commits. You don't need an internet connection to commit your files.<br />
    For the other features, we'll see later.
</p>
<p>
    I took the decision to migrate to GIT mainly because of the social part of GitHub.<br />
    With a GoogleCode project, you got no visibility. But with GitHub, that's very different.
</p>
<p>
    People can see what you're working on, fork your projects, participate easily, etc...<br />
    That's why I'm now going to create GIT projects instead of SVN, even if I'm not as experienced with GIT as I am with SVN.

    So just take a look at my GitHub page, if you're interested: <a href="https://github.com/macmade">https://github.com/macmade</a>
