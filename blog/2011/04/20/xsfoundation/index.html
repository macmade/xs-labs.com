    Long time since I haven't posted here.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently coding eosgarden's next big thing. A project called XSFoundation.<br />
    It consist of a portable C library. By portable, I mean it can run on POSIX compliant systems, such as Mac OS X, Linux, Unix, as well as Windows.
</p>
<p>
    A few time ago, I started an insane project: coding an operating system.<br />
    The base for this OS, named XEOS (x86 Experimental Operating System) is now working, and it's even published on <a href="https://github.com/macmade/XEOS">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The main boot parts are coded in Assembly, and the 32bits kernel is coded in C. It also include a (not yet complete) C89 library.
</p>
<p>
    I also decided to code another library for this OS, the XEOS library, to simplify C programming for XEOS software.<br />
    I ended up with the XSFoundation project. It will be integrated in XEOS once the C library will be complete.
</p>
<p>
    For now, it's a standalone project, and I decided to make it portable on every OS.
</p>
<p>
    XSFoundation is a C library providing object-oriented-like coding in C, reference counting memory management, multi-threading, base objects like array, dictionaries, sets, strings, numbers, URLs, timers, etc.<br />
    The design inspiration comes from Apple's Core Foundation.
</p>
<p>
    Today, I achieved the final portability steps for Windows, which were multi-threading capabilities.<br />
    Now you can have exactly the same code, compiling on Window, Mac or Linux!
</p>
<p>
    I'm now going to code the socket part, so the library will have network capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    The project is also available on GitHub, and is distributed under the terms of the BOOST license:
