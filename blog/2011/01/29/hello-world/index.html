    Welcome to <strong>noxeos</strong>, the new eosgarden's blog!
</p>
<p>
    I'll write down here stuff related to the eosgarden's activities, software development and releases, miscellaneous code related stuff, Mac &amp; iOS development tips, etc.
</p>
<p>
    For the curious, the name noxeos comes from the latin word for night (nox) and the greek word for dawn (eos).<br />
    I choosed it so it can represent the reverse face of the eosgarden website.

    Anyway, thanx for reading this! : )
