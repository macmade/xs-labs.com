    I recently read this amazing book by John Maeda, about simplicity.
</p>
<p>
    I highly recommend it to anyone, developers and designers. John Maeda is at the exact frontier of both worlds, touching excellence...<br />
    He presents what simplicity really is, or sould be, with ten laws to achieve it.
</p>
<p>
    The ten laws are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Reduce</strong>
		The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtfull reduction.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Organize</strong>
		Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Time</strong>
		Savings in time feels like simplicity.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Learn</strong>
		Knowledge makes everything simpler.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Differences</strong>
		Simplicity and complexity need each other.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Context</strong>
		What lies in the peripheral of simplicity is definitively not peripheral.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Emotion</strong>
		More emotions are better than less.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Trust</strong>
		In simplicity we trust.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Failure</strong>
		Some things can never be made simple.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>The one</strong>
		Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each law is described with a pictogram by John Maeda.<br />
    I created some wallpapers with those pictos. They are now displayed each minute on my desktop, remembering me about simplicity, and the need to achieve it, whenever possible.

    But just don't forget to read this book!
