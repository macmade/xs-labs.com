    A few days ago, I received a mail from the swiss hosting company I usually work with.<br />
    They told me the eosgarden's website used too much resources on the shared server. O_o
</p>
<p>
    The traffic has indeed increased. About 300% more, based on Google analytics stats.<br />
    A few apps on MacUpdate, a few tweets about the apps, and badaboum... The server crashed.
</p>
<p>
    So they told me (rudely) I had to switch to a VPS.<br />
    50 bucks more. Mmmm, swiss providers...
</p>
<p>
    So I moved to a provider in France. Now I got a VPS, with Debian 5, for the same price as the shared server!<br />
    The provider is LWS. I have to say the service is great!
