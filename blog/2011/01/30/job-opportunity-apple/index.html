<p>
    Just woke up with a great news today!
</p>
<p>
    I've been contacted by a recruiter from Apple, asking me to send my resume.<br />
    Maybe California is not so far away after all!
</p>
<p>
    It would be a great experience, both at the technical and human level.<br />
    Hope to be able to give more news on the next weeks...

    By the way, the temperature is 19°c in Cupertino. Here, in Switzerland, it's -2°c!!!
