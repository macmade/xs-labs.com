<p>
    I'm very pleased to announce the next software I'm working on: <strong>Codeine</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Codeine is a full-featured code editor, runner and debugger for OS X, supporting C, C++ and Objective-C.<br />
    It uses Clang/LLVM as compiler/linker toolchain, as well as for syntax highlighting, live diagnostics and code-completion.
<p>
    I always dreamed creating such an editor - now it's finally here and running (well, for most parts).
</p>
<p>
    Development as started 2 months ago, and it's getting really fast.<br />
    I've actually no idea when version 1 will be ready, but I'll keep posting here about the project's advancement. So stay tuned... : )
