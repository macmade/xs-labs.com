    iOS 6 is now close to release.
</p>
<p>
    Today, Apple made iOS 6 beta 4 available to registered developers.<br />
    From a developer's perspective, there's quite a lot of changes.<br />
    New APIs, new frameworks, changes in the default UI behavior, better iCloud support (let's say so), etc. As usual you may say.
</p>
<p>
    It's not really the same from a user's perspective, except a few and discreet UI changes and a FaceBook integration (yeah, now my calendar is full of crappy events from «friends»!).
</p>
<p>
    But wait... There's actually one more thing...<br />
    The first iOS 6 beta introduced a brand-new Maps app.
</p>
<p>
    Google's technology is out. Apple rolled-out its own system (or so), now with 3D support. Neat!<br />
    But unfortunately, after a few uses, it turns out this new Maps app is slightly less usable than the previous one, which used Google-Map's services.<br />
    The 3D stuff is nice, indeed, but very limited (for now). And it's actually not as nice as the new 3D stuff from Google.
</p>
<p>
    So what?
</p>
<p>
    It seems Apple and Google are no-longer friends. Wait, were they once actually?<br />
    With iOS 6 beta 4, it's even worse: Apple removed the default YouTube app.<br />
    YouTube is owned by Google, so it's not really a surprise.
</p>
<p>
    But again, let's think from a user's perspective, not from a lawyer's perspective, as Apple's engineers and decision makers seems to do now.<br />
    Accessing YouTube contents will now require downloading a third-party app, maps and associated services are now less accurate...
</p>
<p>
    What's next? Maybe we'll have in a few weeks iOS 6 beta 5, with an Apple made search-engine for Safari and no option to use Google by default...<br />
    I really don't think this is the right way.
</p>
<p>
    Apple's past shows us that sometimes custom proprietary technologies are not the right way of doing awesome stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Personally, it remembers me stuff like ADC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Display_Connector">Apple Display Connector</a>) port. Remember that?<br />
    This was actually brilliant.
</p>
<p>
    Back in 2000, introduced with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube">Power Mac G4 Cube</a> (actually one of my most beloved machine), this was a proprietary modification of the DVI connector, allowing analog and digital display signals, USB and power from the very same cable.<br />
    It was just a dream. One cable to rule them all, finally!<br />
    I first thought that all displays (even PCs displays) would soon adopt this, as a new standard.<br />
    But this was unfortunately proprietary stuff, and the whole stuff ended as a flop.
</p>
<p>
    I'm still crying when I see my <a href="http://www.everymac.com/monitors/apple/studio_cinema/specs/apple_studio_display_17_cl.html">17-Inch CRT Apple Studio Display</a> under my desk, covered with dust.
</p>
<p>
    Recently, Apple rolled-out some amazing new technologies, in partnership with big companies, like Intel.<br />
    It seems they have finally learned from all that past.
</p>
<p>
    Now we have for instance Thunderbolt. As it's also developed by Intel, it guarantees a standard, even in the PC world.<br />
    Having such a standard guarantees the technology won't go away, as the ADC did, and guarantees we'll have soon tons of compatible hardware from the PC market.
</p>
<p>
    Note I previously said: «It seems they have finally learned from all that past».<br />
    With iOS 6, the new Maps app and the removal of YouTube, I'm quite afraid they are beginning to do the same mistake again.<br />
    Maybe (and let's hope so) it's just me. And I would really enjoy being wrong about all this.
</p>
<p>
    But I can't stop thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
    We'll see actually. And of course Apple is now strong enough to do mistakes that would have been hard to recover from a few years ago.<br />
    But thinking as lawyers is not thinking different.
</p>
<p>
    So please guys, think about us, poor stupid users, who just don't care about all your patents...
