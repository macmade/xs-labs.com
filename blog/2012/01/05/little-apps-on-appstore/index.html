    I just published two little apps on the Mac AppStore. Both were successfully validated, and are available for purchase.

    The first one, named «<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autopurge/id480739949?mt=12">AutoPurge</a>» is a UI agent, placed in the menu bar, that automatically frees unused memory based on a specific user-defined time interval.<br />
    It's useful for Macs with low memory capabilities, or for users that use a lot of huge programs, like VMWare, Adobe Creative Suite, Xcode, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Mac OS X doesn't always reclaim the used memory immediately, when a program exits. So if you use a lot of software, your Mac may become slow, as the system will then have to use the hard disk as memory, when all the physical RAM is used.
</p>
<p>
    AutoPurge helps the system to recover the unused memory, making it available again to applications.

<p>
    AutoPurge is available for $0.99, from the Mac AppStore:<br />

    The second one, called «<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sostatus/id490656622?mt=12">SOStatus</a>», provides you with real-time informations from your <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> account, from the menu bar.
</p>
<p>
    It's available for $0.99 too, from the Mac AppStore:<br />
