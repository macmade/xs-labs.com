<p>
    When working on a software project, you may sometimes have to mix programming languages.<br />
    It may be because you need to use some specific libraries, because of code portability needs, whatever.
</p>
<p>
    When coding a Mac OS X (or iOS) application, you are usually going to use Objective-C as main language.<br />
    It's not mandatory, as you can use the old Carbon API, or stuff like QT (C++), but it will usually be easier, at least for all the UI related stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Mixing C with Objective-C is not a problem, as Objective-C is a strict superset of C.<br />
    Whether you have pure C code, or if you are linking with a C library, there's no issue.
</p>
<p>
    Mixing C or Objective-C with C++ is not as easy.<br />
    Although C++ was originally based on the C language, it's not strictly a superset, so trying to use C++ code from C or Objective-C may not be always easy.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, with Objective-C, you have the possibility to use Objective-C++ (.mm files).<br />
    This way, you can use all the C++ features within Objective-C code.
</p>
<p>
    But sometimes, this is not wanted. Moreover, it's of course impossible with pure C.
</p>
<p>
    Before going on, let's take a little example in pure C.<br />
    We are going to code a typical «hello world» application.
</p>
<p>
    For this, we decide to have a file for our program's main function, and another file for utility functions.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start by the utility functions file.<br />
    First of all, we need to create a header file, named «lib.h»:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-c">
#ifndef __LIB_H__
#define __LIB_H__

void say_hello( void );

#endif
</pre>
<p>
    We declare here the prototype of a function named «say_hello».<br />
    We are now going to provide an implementation, in a new file named «lib.c»:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "lib.h"

void say_hello( void )
{
    printf( "hello, world\n" );
}
</pre>
<p>
    Nothing special here.
    Now let's create our program's main function, in a file named «main.c»:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-c">
#include "lib.h"

int main( void )
{
    say_hello();
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
    Here, we just use our «say_hello» function, before exiting the program.
</p>
<p>
    Let's take a look at the compilation.
    We are going to generate an object file (.o) for each C file, and then link them together.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with «lib.c»:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -o lib.o -c lib.c
</pre>
<p>
    From the «lib.c» source file, we generate an object file (machine code) named «lib.o».
    We can use the «nm» command to list the symbols available in that object file:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
nm lib.o
</pre>
<p>
    It will output:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
0000000000000028 s EH_frame0
0000000000000015 s L_.str
                 U _puts
0000000000000000 T _say_hello
0000000000000040 S _say_hello.eh
</pre>
<p>
    We can see here our «say_hello» function.<br />
    As you can see, it has a leading underscore. This is totally normal.
</p>
<p>
    Now let's create an object file from «main.c»:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -o main.o -c main.c
</pre>
<p>
    Now, we have two distinct object files.<br />
    In order to create an executable, we need to link them. This can be done with:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -o test lib.o main.o
</pre>
<p>
    This will create an executable named «test», which will just print «hello, world» when run.
</p>
<p>
    Piece of cake.<br />
    But now imagine we want to use C++ for the library part, and C for the other parts.
</p>
<p>
    First of all, we are going to rename «lib.c» to «lib.cpp».<br />
    The «lib.h» header doesn't need to be changed.
</p>
<p>
    We are also going to replace the implementation of the «say_hello» function, so it uses «IOStream» instead of «printf()».<br />
    Our «lib.cpp» file will now look like that:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "lib.h"

void say_hello( void )
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "hello, world" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
<p>
    No problem here, just a standard C++ hello world.<br />
    Let's recompile everything (note that we are now going to use g++ instead of gcc for the C++ file):
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
g++ -Wall -o lib.o -c lib.cpp
gcc -Wall -o main.o -c main.c
</pre>
<p>
    No problem here. Let's link the two files in order to create an executable, as previously:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
gcc -Wall -o test lib.o main.o
</pre>
<p>
    Unfortunately, you'll have linker errors here, such as:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "std::cout", referenced from:
      say_hello()    in lib.o

      _main in main.o

</pre>
<p>
    Ok, obviously we are not linked with the C++ standard library.<br />
    This is because we used gcc to create our final executable.
</p>
<p>
    So let's use g++ for the final stage.<br />
    Note that we will still use gcc for the «main.c» file, as it's still pure C code.<br />
    No need for a C++ compiler here:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
g++ -Wall -o lib.o -c lib.cpp
gcc -Wall -o main.o -c main.c
g++ -Wall -o test lib.o main.o
</pre>
<p>
    We still got a linker error:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_say_hello", referenced from:
      _main in main.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
</pre>
<p>
    Here, we can see we are effectively linked with the C++ standard library, as the errors for the «std::» members, like «std::cout» are gone.
</p>
<p>
    But it seems that the C++ version of our «say_hello» function is not found.
    Let's take a look at the «lib.o» file, to find out what's wrong.
    We are going to use the «nm» command again, to list the symbols available in that file:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
nm lib.o
</pre>
<p>
    The result is:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">

00000000000001a8 s ___tcf_0.eh
</pre>
<p>
    There's no symbol for our «say_hello» function.<br />
    Instead, we have:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
__Z9say_hellov
</pre>
<p>
    What's this «_Z9» prefix?<br />
    Ever heard of «name mangling»?
</p>
<p>
    First of all, remember that C++ has built-in support for function overloading.<br />
    It means that the following example is perfectly valid:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-c">
void foo( int x );
void foo( double x );
int  foo( int x );
</pre>
<p>
    Here, we've got three functions named «foo».<br />
    In C or Objective-C, this is not possible, as a symbol can only be defined once.
</p>
<p>
    In C++, this is called «function overloading». A function (or method) can have multiple implementations, as long as there is a difference in the return type and/or the arguments.
</p>
<p>
    The compiler will then generate three different functions, and automatically choose which one to use when you issue a call, depending on the return type and the argument types.
</p>
<p>
    In order to do this, as the compiler will create different functions, it will have to use different symbol names.<br />
    That's why C++ functions (or methods) have a modified symbol name, in the resulting object code.
</p>
<p>
    So how can we deal with this, from our «main.c» file?<br />
    With Objective-C++, it would have worked, of course. But not with pure C, or pure Objective-C.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, there is a way to tell the C++ compiler to comply with C-like declarations, so it won't use its calling conventions (with mangled names) when producing object code.
</p>
<p>
    This way, our C++ function will be callable from pure-C (even if it's implementation uses C++ features).
</p>
<p>
    In order to do this, we just need to change the «lib.h» header file:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-c">
#ifndef __LIB_H__
#define __LIB_H__

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

void say_hello( void );

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif
</pre>
<p>
    When the C++ compiler is used, the «__cplusplus» macro is defined.<br />
    Now, in such a case, our function's prototype will be wrapped with:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-cpp">
extern "C" {
}
</pre>
<p>
    This will tell the C++ compiler that we intend to use everything inside the braces from C code, meaning it will generate symbol names according to C.
</p>
<p>
    So let's recompile our «lib.cpp» file into object code:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
g++ -Wall -o lib.o -c lib.cpp
</pre>
<p>
    Now, if we run «nm», we can see:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
0000000000000100 s EH_frame0
00000000000000eb s L_.str
0000000000000070 s __GLOBAL__I_say_hello
0000000000000148 s __GLOBAL__I_say_hello.eh
0000000000000090 s __Z41__static_initialization_and_destruction_0ii
0000000000000178 s __Z41__static_initialization_and_destruction_0ii.eh
                 U __ZNSolsEPFRSoS_E
                 U __ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev
                 U __ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev
                 U __ZSt4cout
                 U __ZSt4endlIcSt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIT_T0_ES6_
00000000000001d8 b __ZStL8__ioinit
                 U __ZStlsISt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIcT_ES5_PKc
                 U ___cxa_atexit
                 U ___dso_handle
0000000000000040 t ___tcf_0
00000000000001a8 s ___tcf_0.eh
0000000000000000 T _say_hello
0000000000000118 S _say_hello.eh
</pre>
<p>
    Hurray! The symbol name for our «say_hello» function is now «_say_hello» as with pure C.<br />
    It means we are now able to link our object files, in order to produce the executable:
</p>
<pre class="code-block nohighlight">
g++ -Wall -o test lib.o main.o
</pre>
<p>
    No error here. Our executable was successfully produced, and is working fine!
</p>
<p>
    Of course, when using «extern "C" {}», you can no more use C++ stuff like function's overloading, or namespaces (and of course classes).<br />
    But this way, when providing functions implemented in C++, you can make them available to C code, and so to Objective-C as well.
</p>
