    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop-wpf/data/data-binding-overview">Bindings</a> are an essential part of the WPF Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.<br />
    They allow to react to changes in the view or model without any glue code.
</p>
<p>
    Also as a Mac developer using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html">Cocoa Bindings</a>, I usually feel right at home with WPF bindings.<br />
    It allows very similar patterns when porting an app to Windows.
</p>
<p>
    However, bindings in WPF require a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-properties-overview">Dependency Property</a> - that is a special object that will take care of the update and notification mechanisms for your properties.
</p>
<p>
    With Apple technologies, this is handled by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html">KVO</a>, which is basically part of the runtime.<br />
    As an example, in Swift, the only requirement for a KVO property is dynamic dispatch, meaning the following declaration can be used with bindings:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-swift">
import Foundation

class Foo: NSObject
{
    @objc public dynamic var title: String?
}
</pre>
<p>
    Compared to a regular property, we only added <code>@objc</code> and <code>dynamic</code>.
</p>
<p>
    In WPF, this is unfortunately not as easy.<br />
    As mentionned previously, bindings in WPF require a Dependency Property. This object has to be created (or registered) in order for bindings to work.
</p>
<p>
    This leads to the following code:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp">
using System.Windows;

class Foo
{
    public static readonly DependencyProperty TitleProperty = DependencyProperty.Register
    (
        "Title",
        typeof( string ),
        typeof( MyClass ),
        new PropertyMetadata( null )
    );

    public string Title
    {
        get => this.GetValue( TitleProperty ) as string;
        set => this.SetValue( TitleProperty, value );
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    First, as a static member, we register the Dependency Property, specifying its name, type, owner type and other metadata such as default value.<br />
    Then we need to declare the property accessors, that will redirect to the dependency property itself.
</p>
<p>
    And obviously, the same code has to be repeated for every property we want to use with bindings.<br />
    It leads to a lot of boilerplate code, and it's very easy to introduce bugs when copy-pasting such code, such as a typo in the property name or a wrong type or owner type.<br />
    Such bugs will usually result in an exception being thrown.
</p>
<p>
    At <a href="https://imazing.com">DigiDNA</a>, we developped a tiny module allowing a more compact declaration for Dependency Properties:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp">
using System.Windows;
using BetterDP;

class Foo
{
    static Foo()
    {
        DP.InitializeProperties( typeof( Foo ) );
    }

    [DP]
    public string Title
    {
        get => this.Get< string >();
        set => this.Set( value );
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The only requirement is a call to <code>DP.InitializeProperties</code> in the class' static constructor.<br />
    Then, all properties may be decorated with the <code>DP</code> attribute to turn them into dependency properties, along with calling the generic <code>Get</code> and <code>Set</code> methods in the accessors.
</p>
<p>
    Default values may be set directly from the <code>DP</code> attribute:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp">
[DP( DefaultValue = 42 )]
public int Count
{
    get => this.Get< int >();
    set => this.Set( value );
}
</pre>
<p>
    You may also be notified about a property change by declaring a <code>DependencyPropertyDidChange</code> method in your class, such as:
</p>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp">
protected void DependencyPropertyDidChange( string name, object value )
{}
</pre>
<p>
    This library is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/DigiDNA/BetterDP">GitHub</a>.  
    It is also available as a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BetterDP/">NuGet package</a>.
