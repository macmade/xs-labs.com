    A few updates on the Apple 1 Replica project, as things are getting serious... : )
</p>
<p>
    I recently told my fellow fellow teammates at <a href="http://www.digidna.net/">DigiDNA</a> about my project. They found it awesome, and they kindly proposed me to sponsor it.
</p>
<p>
    So we decided to create a dedicated blog on Tumblr, to log everything related to it.<br />
    My friend Vic and I will post there about the advancements of the project, and a few other stuff related to electronics and old computers.
</p>
<p>
    So check-out the <a href="http://xs-one.tumblr.com/">XS-One Tumblr blog</a> if you want to stay updated...<br />
    See you soon there! : )
