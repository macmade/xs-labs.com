<p>
    Last week was my last week as a software engineer at DigiDNA, publisher of <a href="http://www.imazing.com/">iMazing</a> (previously DiskAid).
</p>
<p>
    It has been four awesome years working with the folks at DigiDNA.<br />
    Leaving such a job is always sad, but I decided it was time for me to move towards new experiences and challenges.
</p>
<p>
    iMazing is an iPhone and iPad management utility, available for Mac and Windows.<br />
    It used to be called <strong>DiskAid</strong>, until recently.
</p>
<p>
    When I was hired back in 2011, version 5 of DiskAid was near completion.<br />
    I did a few debugging, as well as a few UI works for the Mac version.
<p>
    But at the time, my main focus was the company's iPhone applications, namely <strong>FileApp</strong> and <strong>FileApp Pro</strong>, which I ended rewriting completely.

    Left to right: FileApp's original icon, refactored version, actual version.
</p>
<p>
    The rewrite was a huge risk, but it ended as a true success.<br />
    So we decided to apply the same strategy for the next version of DiskAid. Obviously, this was even more risky.
</p>
<p>
    But approximatively a year later, we were able to ship the all new DiskAid 6, bringing tons of new features, multiple device capabilities, a whole new user interface, etc.<br />
    This was truly awesome, seeing all that hard work going live.

    DiskAid evolution: version 4.7 and 6.7.
</p>
<p>
    The next year, we crafted the Windows version, while keeping adding feature to the Mac version.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, last year, DiskAid was renamed <strong>iMazing</strong>.<br />
    At the occasion, we brought a more elegant user interface, finely tuned for Apple's new operating system - OS X Yosemite.
</p>
<p class="text-center small">

    iMazing current version.
</p>
<p>
    And obviously, tons of new features like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcoBp7MYiPY">copying music to the device</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I was personally in charge for that last one, and it surely was a hell.<br />
    But again, after months without sleep, seeing such an awaited feature going live is truly amazing (pun intended).
</p>
<p>
    I really feel like we did an incredibly awesome job these last years, and I want to thank all of the fantastic guys at DigiDNA.<br />
    I think we really brought iMazing to the level it deserves, and I'm leaving with a confident and clear mind.
</p>
<p>
    So now let's head for new stories!<br />
    Cheers guys!
